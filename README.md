# SubBundles

Unsupervised learning applied to white matter bundles to identify candidate streamline subgroups with set of commonalities

Subbundles should be:

- Substantially different

  *[Otsuâ€™s criterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method)* 
  
  - variance within subbundle small

  - variance across subbundles large
  
- [Reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)) across individuals


## Objective

[Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) applied to [white matter bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_tract) to identify candidate subbundles

## Targeting Conference Abstract Deadlines

## Streamlines, SubBundles, and Bundles

<span style="color:blue">**TODO: Clarify Context: What, Why, and How**</span>

- Thinking here about backround references

Since can't assess directly using dMRI to infer streamlines

- what properties do we have available

  - positional
  
  - dti therefore can infer tissue properties
  
  - relaxometry
  
Other information from other methods, techniques, technology?

## Axons and Fiber Tracts

Questions: Groups of axons as fiber tracts (or groups of fiber tracts)

- Why group axons?

  - Functionality

- Is fiber a whole bundle or a part of a bundle?

- Information is communicated

  - What
  
  - Where
  
  - When
  
  - How

- Geometric

    - Location

      - Absolute Location: Where are axons located within brain

      - Relative Location: Proximity to other axons, functional brain areas

    - Where to axons start and end (end points)

      - Which end points are equivalent

      - Terminate in gray matter/cortex

    - Orientation

    - Tajectory

      - What path does the axon take to get to destination

- Tissue properties

  - Mylenation (therefore: speed of spikes)
  
  - Diameter (Caliber)
